Unreal Engine 5.3 project called Oasis, only the code(C++)

It's a Action game set in Desert Oasis Environment where you can break stuff and get different items. 
You can also hit enemies form any direction and they react to that hit event and play particular Animation Montage and VFX. 
Main Character(MC) can have one or two weapons and can generate Hit Events, I also added the Character Movement, Animation Blueprint, Animation Montages, SFX and VFX for the MC.
Talking about Enemy, the behaviour is derived from AI, it uses AIController and react to the states like Dead, Patrolling, Chasing, Attacking, Engaged and NoState.
